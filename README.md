Customer Segmentation Using Clustering (K-Means & Agglomerative Clustering)
🚀 Overview: In this project, I applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data. By leveraging algorithms like K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering, I grouped customers into meaningful segments that can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies.

🔍 Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering.

Clustering Algorithms: Used K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering to identify customer segments based on features like income, spending, family size, and more.

Dimensionality Reduction: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and visualize the data in 3D.

Data Visualizations: Created compelling visualizations to understand patterns in customer spending and behavior, including 3D scatter plots and heatmaps.

💡 What I learned: This project gave me hands-on experience with unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction, which are widely used in customer analytics, marketing, and business intelligence. It also helped me refine my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering.

🔧 Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn (for clustering)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

Yellowbrick (for visualizing the Elbow method)

📈 Results:

Successfully identified 4 distinct customer segments.

Visualized customer profiles based on key features like income, spending, and family size.
